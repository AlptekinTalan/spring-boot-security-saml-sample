spring-boot-security-saml-sample
================================

Currently Spring Security SAML module doesn't not provide a starter for Spring Boot. Moreover, its configuration is XML-based as of this writing. The aim of this project is to explain how to develop a Service Provider (SP) which uses Spring Boot (1.4.0) and Spring Security SAML Extention (1.0.0.RC3-SNAPSHOT), by defining an annotation-based configuration (Java Configuration). Thymeleaf (2.1.1) is also used as template engine.
